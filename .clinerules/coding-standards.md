# Coding Standards

## Project Structure

-   **Organize by feature**: Group related files by feature/domain rather than by type
-   **Consistent naming**: Use PascalCase for directories and file names
-   **Layer separation**: Maintain clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers

## Code Quality

-   **SOLID principles**: Follow Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles
-   **DRY principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common code into reusable components
-   **Clean code**: Write self-documenting code with meaningful names and clear structure
-   **Cognitive complexity**: Keep method cognitive complexity at 15 or less to maintain readability and understandability
-   **Using statements**: Remove all unused using statements to keep code clean and maintainable

## C# Specific Guidelines

-   **Async/await**: Use async/await for I/O operations and long-running tasks
-   **Exception handling**: Use specific exception types and avoid catching generic Exception
-   **Null safety**: Prefer nullable reference types and use null-coalescing operators appropriately
-   **LINQ**: Use LINQ for data transformations when it improves readability
-   **CLS compliance**: Mark all assemblies with `[assembly: CLSCompliant(true)]` or `[assembly: CLSCompliant(false)]` to explicitly declare CLS compliance

## Testing

-   **Unit tests**: Write unit tests for all business logic
-   **Test naming**: Use descriptive test method names following the pattern `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult`
-   **Test coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic
-   **Test structure**: Include `// Arrange`, `// Act`, and `// Assert` comments in each test to clearly separate the three phases
-   **Assertion library**: Use the built-in assertion library (`Assert`) - do not use 3rd party libraries like FluentAssertions
-   **Mocking framework**: If mocking is required, use NSubstitute

## Code Review

-   **Persistent records**: Generate a file with code review results in addition to chat output
-   **File format**: Use Markdown format with timestamp (e.g., `code-review-results-2025-11-04-143022.md`) for review documentation
-   **Content structure**: Include summary of findings, detailed issues with references, suggested fixes, and action items
-   **Input validation**: Arguments to public methods should be validated

## Documentation

-   **XML comments**: Document public APIs with XML comments, including constructors, methods, properties, and classes
-   **README files**: Maintain up-to-date README files for projects and major components
-   **Code comments**: Use comments sparingly, preferring self-documenting code

## Dependencies

-   **Minimal dependencies**: Only add dependencies that are necessary and well-maintained
-   **Version pinning**: Use specific versions for dependencies to ensure reproducible builds
-   **Security**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities
-   **Centralized package management**: Use Directory.Packages.props for centralized NuGet package version management
    -   Remove duplicate elements from .csproj files
    -   Ensure .csproj files contain correct PackageReference entries without version attributes
    -   Maintain accurate PackageVersion entries in Directory.Packages.props

## Performance

-   **Efficient algorithms**: Choose appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task
-   **Resource management**: Properly dispose of resources using `using` statements or `IDisposable`
-   **Async best practices**: Avoid blocking calls in async methods

## Project Creation

-   **Test projects**: Create an empty XUnit test project alongside each Web API project, named with the Web API project name suffixed with ".Tests"
-   **Project organization**: Place each new project in its own dedicated folder for better organization
