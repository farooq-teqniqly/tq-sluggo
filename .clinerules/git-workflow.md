# Git Workflow Rules

## Branch Management

-   **Never commit directly to main branch**: All code changes must be committed to feature branches only
-   **Feature branch requirement**: Create and use descriptive feature branches for all development work
-   **Branch selection**: If unsure which feature branch to use, always ask the user for clarification before proceeding

## Remote Operations

-   **No unauthorized pushes**: Never push to remote repositories without explicit user permission
-   **Push confirmation**: Always confirm with the user before executing any `git push` commands
-   **Remote safety**: Prioritize local commits over remote operations to maintain user control

## General Guidelines

-   Follow standard git branching workflow (feature branches, pull requests, etc.)
-   Maintain clean commit history with meaningful commit messages
-   Respect user's git workflow preferences and security boundaries
